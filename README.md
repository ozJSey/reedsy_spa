# Hello, it's Oz.

I have no experience in Jest, there was some advanced cases I could put test to but I've failed, and I didn't want to put some basic tests just for the sake of it. Perhaps I will need to see professional tests in order to code those. Have mercy on it please.

Thank you for collaboration and the time you will spend during it :)

# I have created this with standard vue create so npm i && npm run serve should be sufficent.
